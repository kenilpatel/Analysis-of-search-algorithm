In this folder we have 7 python files 


AVG.py - For average case analysis of algorithms 

Worst.py - For worst case analysis of algorithms 

BS.py - Implementation of Binary search 

BST.py - Implementation of Binary search tree 

Linear.py - Implementation of linear search 

Rbtree.py - Implementation of red black tree 

driver.py - Common user interaction program 



In order to run analysis of algorithms or to run any particluar algorithm we have to run only one program driver.py 

When you run driver.py, program will ask you for choice 

choices are as follow 

Press 1 for worst case analysis
Press 2 for average case analysis
Press 3 for Linear Search
Press 4 for Binary Search
Press 5 for Binary Search tree
Press 6 for Red black tree
press 0 for exit



If you choose number from 3,4,5,6 then user willl get two choices as follow 

Press 1 to run algorithm on inbuilt data
Press 2 to run algorithm from user input

If you press 1 then selected search algorithm will run for inbuilt data 

If you press 2 then program will ask you to enter size of array and data of the array, then user has to enter the key to be searched in array.


If you 1,2 then program will generate graph for analysis
